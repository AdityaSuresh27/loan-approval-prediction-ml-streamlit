## 🔍 Problem Statement

Financial institutions face challenges in processing loan applications quickly and consistently. Manual loan approvals can be slow, error-prone, and inconsistent. This project aims to automate the process using a machine learning model trained on real-world data.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

- Train a machine learning classifier (Random Forest) on historical loan application data.
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categories).
- Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deploy as a Streamlit web app where users can input loan details and get instant predictions.

Happy coding guys, 
P.S. When you run train_model.py the pkl files are made and accuracy will be given as output, and then you just run 'streamlit run main.py' in cmd.
